#### ToDo

- [ ] Render path (contour)
  - [ ] **Contour** class with Cavalier Contours and GDNative
  - [ ] Contour Editor (lines and biarcs) - Godot tool
    Every road has a center line, and 2 boundary lines. Adding lanes adds 2 lines. Where guideline is G and lane center is C and lane boundaries are |:
  ```
  2 lanes   1 lane    3 lanes
  5 lines   3 lines   7 lines
  |C|C|     |C|       |C|G|C|
  |CGC|     |G|       |C|G|C|
  |C|C|     |C|       |C|G|C|
  ```
  If angle is too small it is a line else biarc.
  Every lane has join handles, only guide path has a length handle.
- [ ] Link multiple contours
  - [ ] Find intersections
    Contour endpoint to part of a path. Endpoint control hidden/locked.
    TODO Think about mostly _stable_ intersections
  - [ ] Draw intersections and lanes
- [ ] Add layers (bridges, tunnels)
  Connection biarcs at intermediate z-indices.
